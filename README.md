1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mubashirnas1r/is_project_frontend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your working directory to the newly cloned project folder:

   ```bash
   cd is_project_frontend
   ```

3. **Create a Simple Python Server:**
   Python comes with a built-in module called `http.server` that can be used to quickly set up a simple web server. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 5500
   ```

   This command starts a server on port 5500. If you are using Python 3, you can use `python3` instead of `python`.

4. **Access the Local Website:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5500`. You should see website running locally.
